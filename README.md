This repository documents ADR-0002, an Architecture Decision Record that establishes the baseline governance framework for program stakeholder management and communications planning.

The objective of this ADR is to define how stakeholders are identified, analyzed, engaged, and communicated with throughout the program lifecycle, using formal governance artifacts and version-controlled execution documentation.

This work was completed as part of the IBM Program Management curriculum on Coursera, and is structured to reflect real-world PMO and enterprise governance standards.

Scope

ADR-0002 governs:

Program stakeholder identification and classification

Stakeholder interest and influence analysis

Communication cadence, channels, and ownership

Governance controls for post-baseline change


The ADR is supported by execution artifacts maintained in Excel to preserve formatting integrity and usability.

Artifacts

The following execution artifacts support ADR-0002:

Program Stakeholder Register

Identifies executive, governance, operational, and delivery stakeholders

Documents interest level, influence level, concerns, and ownership


Program Communications Management Plan

Defines communication channels, frequency, and responsible owners

Aligns messaging with stakeholder influence and decision authority



These files are uploaded separately to preserve Excel formatting and data integrity.

Maintenance

This Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is maintained as a living governance artifact. Supporting execution artifacts—including the Program Stakeholder Register and Program Communications Management Plan—are updated as the program evolves to reflect changes in scope, stakeholders, or communication needs.

All updates are version-controlled through Git commit history to preserve traceability, accountability, and audit readiness. Changes are documented with clear intent, ensuring that stakeholder engagement decisions remain transparent and reviewable throughout the program lifecycle.


---

Baseline

ADR-0002 was formally baselined under the Git tag adr-0002-baseline. This baseline represents the approved and immutable starting point for the program’s stakeholder and communications governance framework.

All subsequent modifications are considered post-baseline updates and are recorded through controlled versioning. These updates do not alter the original intent or approved structure of ADR-0002, but instead reflect responsible program evolution as stakeholder needs and execution realities change.


---

Governance Alignment

This ADR aligns with:

PMO governance practices

Program lifecycle management standards

Enterprise audit and traceability expectations

Controlled change and decision documentation principles
